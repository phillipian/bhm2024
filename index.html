          Black History Month takes place from February 1 to March 1. The month includes the celebration of Black contributions throughout all periods of history, and entails sharing stories beyond racism and enslavement to spotlight Black achievement. This month is but one more reason to celebrate the rich culture, contributions, and profound history of the Black community.

        </p>

        <p>For Black History Month this year, <em>The Phillipian</em> rreached out to some Black-identifying 
          Andover students and faculty to ask about their thoughts on this month of celebration and their achievements 
          within the Black community at Andover.

        <br>
        <p class="longquote"> Black History Month to me, I think, is more so a time for I guess, I mean it’s definitely time for Black people to celebrate, but I think more so a time for nonBlack people to learn more about Black culture and just different people around us with different cultures and experiences. I feel like as a Black person, like, I'm happy every day to be Black. Like, you know, there's never a time. Damn. Like, I'm happy to be here. You know? So I just hope, like, during this month, other people see, like, Black voices for who they are and, like, trying to break down different types of, like, stereotypes, especially on, like, a Predominantly White Institution campus where people may not be able to interact with Black people on a more intimate level as much. Like, I hope Black History Month is a time for people to educate themselves, whether that be by, you know, making a new Black friend, watching Madea, going to the Black Arts dance, like, just realizing that it's Black History Month and celebrating Black people and Black greatness around you.

</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Ozochi Onunaku ’25</h4>
        <br>
        <p class="longquote">For me, Black History Month is a month where we are able to look back on and commemorate the achievements of many people within the Black generations before us as well as the Black generation of today. It means highlighting the successes and the overcoming of struggles and challenges that Black people have faced in a multitude of different industries across the world and how each and every one of them differed from each other in being able to find success and happiness despite the anti-Black challenges that they might have faced. And I love Black History Month because it not only focuses on the hardships that Black people have faced, which is really important to know because it provides important context, but it also focuses and balances out Black culture, the many different forms of Black culture, Black music, Black literature, Black talent. All these different aspects of what I feel would define Black success and weighing Black success and Black struggle on the same scale during Black history month is what completes the month for me. And the way I celebrate it is that I don't necessarily celebrate it as a holiday, but instead I take part in events on campus that seek to highlight Black achievement. For example, we have had this event called Black People's Got Talent, which showcased the talent of Black students on campus, and I really appreciate the show for what it has done. 
 <br><br>We’ve also worked extensively with the Black Student Union, AfLatAm, and the ASA, collaborating with each other to work on the Black History Month event schedule. And so we have created a list of events in order to celebrate Black History Month with the student body, specifically focusing on Black students at Andover, and through those events, I feel like I'm able to take my part in celebrating Black History Month.


</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">McKenzie Williams ’24</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">Black History Month is just another reason to celebrate my culture. 
          This month specifically is a reminder of who I am and where I came from. It is a nice opportunity for me to do
           more learning and research, and immerse myself more in my own culture. So to celebrate, I’m just doing a lot 
           more consumption from Black creators: whether it is listening to Black music artists or watching Black movies or
            Black television shows; just, consuming all that I can.
</p>

        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Casey Alexander Smith, Arts Instructor</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">Black History Month, for me, is the start of Black history year because 
          you should be celebrating all year around. So, I like to utilize this month, not only because it is also 
          my birth month and also the month of love, but because it has been dubbed Black History Month to start the 
          celebration of identity within one’s self; love from within, I think is most important. So, within the month,
          I personally try to find out things that are new to me. There are a lot of online researchers who are talking 
          about Black inventors, Black historians, things that are not within the textbooks. They were definitely not within
           my textbooks when I was growing up, and they are slowly starting to trickle into some of the contemporary textbooks.
            So, yeah. I try to educate myself as best as I can to try to push throughout the rest of the year.
</p>
        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Dominique Williams ’24</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
          What does this month mean to me? I'll have to admit, it's changed since coming to Andover because Black History Month at home, to me, looked different than being here. So Black History Month at home, it was a lot about, I guess, like, the diaspora, and using this time to connect with, what it means to be Afro-Caribbean, the descendants of African enslaved ancestors, and more so along the lines of independence. And so when I first came to the US and came to Andover, I wasn't really sure what Black History Month on this campus meant to me, but I would say that now that I've been here for a while, learning about civil rights and Black Lives Matter and the continual, I guess just overall, the struggle for Black voices to be heard, I would say that, to me personally, it's made me more appreciative of the Black Arts Movement. That's something that I'm recently starting to gain more appreciation for. So I would say this month, I'm kind of making it my own personal Black Arts Month and using this month as an opportunity to educate myself.
<br><br>So I'm reading James Baldwin and more work by Black poets. While I have always been an RnB fan, I'm planning to listen more to soul music, like I have been listening to a lot of Aretha Franklin lately.

        <p class="longquote">
          Black History Month, for me, is a time for me to spend time with my friends and just talk about our experiences or share our experiences with other people however we can. As Black students are a minority on our campus, Black History Month really empowers us and fosters a space where Blackness is celebrated. We can see this celebration of Blackness through all the events that are happening: The BHM Talent Show, for example, was an event that I enjoyed personally, and I got to see a lot of other non-Black students enjoy it with their friends. There was also the Black Arts Dance, which in my opinion is the best dance at any point in the school year. These events are always well-populated, well-planned, and it's just really nice to see us Black people having fun and spreading joy. I try to be there and uplift the energy of everyone that is working so hard to make this month magical.
</p>
        <h4 style="font-size: 20px;">Hananie Albert, English Instructor</h4><br>
        <p class="longquote">
          For me, Black History Month is about valorizing Blackness as a critical lens. It's by valorizing Blackness as a humanizing ethos that calls to our essential humanity and reminds us of where we've been as well as where we've yet to go. And so for me, I usually choose a new book or something to read during Black History Month. I'm reading a new book on the intertwined histories of Haitians and African Americans. It's been a good read so far.

        <br>
        <p class="longquote"> You know, that’s an interesting question because I think that there is an expectation for Blackness to be a monolith, which it is not, and this campus is full of so many different types of Blackness. It is also full of people celebrating their intersectional identities, and I think that that is the beauty of Blackness, the resilience, the exposure to not only one aspect of culture, but the variety and diversity of culture. As we all know, Blackness has inspired music, it has inspired food, it has inspired dance, it has inspired all sorts of culture, so when I see the variety of all of those things on campus, from food in Commons to SLAM, or any variety of things, I think that is a celebration of Blackness.

           I truly think that I have not seen such a genuine celebration of Blackness as I did that night of karaoke night. For me, that night was an impressive display of Black excellence. And although, yes, the event was open to the whole community, up in the front where the Black students were, the amount of love and joy that was given to everybody was amazing, and there was no animosity whatsoever. Black people from all groups, all cultures, all identities really just came together to celebrate one another and just be, and that was just so beautiful to see.

          This year, BSU was geared more towards collaborations with other clubs in order to highlight the intersectionality of Black identity. So our biggest ones are a collaboration with ASL to learn Black-American sign language. Then we have our faculty student dinner, and honestly, that is one of the most important one’s for me, just Black students getting to connect with Black faculty because you don’t always get to be in their classes and it's just nice to have that mentorship. <br><br> Then, of course, we have fun ones. For example, we have the talent show: Black People’s Got Talent. We had quite a few acts lined up. Another big one was the Black Arts Dance, which is always awesome.

          The Black History Month calendar is a big part of what we are doing. In terms of Blackness being celebrated on campus, I think in some ways it lacks because while we do have this recognition of Black History Month, I think for students who are not Black it is not really a big part of their lives and although these events are open to everyone they are definitely directed towards the Black community. Like, we see the library display of Black authors, but I feel like if you are not Black chances are you might just walk past it, and so I think in some ways we have a responsibility to open our arms more, and to give the broader community more ways to celebrate with us. make sure that we are being open about the way that we celebrate.

          I think Black History Month this year is pretty busy. I was really happy with the calendar this year. We have the Black Arts dance this weekend, which I do think we could have done more advertising for, but I'm really excited for that one. And I think, again, like, going in about just different parts of, like, the Black identity. I think that's really important because, like, this year, we've started, like, African Student Association. It's just really cool to be able to interact with a new Black student group. Especially since our very own Black student Union started recently, last year, too.

          <br><br> I think it's really cool how AfLatAm is able to interact with those two different spaces and also, like, AfLatAmis able to celebrate our Afro-Latinas. Like, I think it's really cool how we just interact actually, like, so many different groups to have so many different, just different events. And, like, I know ASA had a host to learn how to do some dances. I know there was a day where people could wear their traditional outfits.
          <br><br>We also have the black arts dance this Saturday, and then more exploring intersectionality. We have a collaboration with GSA. Both of our Co-Heads on AfLatAm are on GSA board, too, so I'm sure that's gonna turn out amazing. And then we have faculty students dinner coming up with some delicious food, Sisterhood for Galentines (Valentines) Day.
          <br><br>There's just, you know, a lot of really, really fun stuff. And even, like, the off campus roller skating trip. Like, that's gonna be a blast. We're gonna have too much fun. I am just really really excited for everything; it’s going to be a great time.

          Honestly, I almost feel as though Andover is becoming more complacent. Coming from 2020 and seeing the reckoning moment that the country was having, I feel like this has been one of the more lackluster Black History Months that I've seen at this school. Andover couldn't even keep the Black History Month banners up for more than a week. More seriously, though, I feel like there's not enough awareness of Black History Month on campus; even Snooze the Blues is more prominent on this campus than Black History Month. It can't be MLK Day and done. The students in CaMD groups are really putting in the effort to make this month special and to make this a month of reflection and celebration, so I'm a little bit disappointed that, you know, as far as I know, there is not enough administrative action to recognize this month and the significance that it should have, not just for Black students, but for all students.

          I was an AMP mentor last year, and just through being a part of AfLatAm and BSU I try to be there for other students. Rightly so, there's a lot of Blackness within CaMD, but I feel like there needs to be a lot of Blackness outside of CaMD, like in big STEM clubs or The Phillipian or in orchestra. And so one of the things that I am a little bit proud of is, like being in PASC. I also have to shout-out Suhaila because Suhaila was also working alongside me trying to bring our Blackness and our perspective to other spaces on campus, thinking specifically about environmental space. <br><br>
          For the few months that I have left on campus, I want to step up my mentorship game because one thing I remember was that when I was a Lower, I had a few Black upperclassmen like Alicia and Amina who I really looked up to. I feel like it's so important to have that community. Just having someone to look up to is very special, especially when that person is someone who looks like you in spaces where there might not be that many Black people. That’s something that I cherish.

         I’d like to think that I am always contributing to the Black community by existing, and existing as my authentic self. However, there are efforts that I take, working with some of the departments of campus to bring folks together. Sometimes that is people who identify as Black, people who identify as People of Color. I’ve particularly worked with men of color on campus, so that’s inclusive of Black and other identities. But, yeah, I try to bring communities together to celebrate in small and medium groups for different reasons. Some of that happens on campus, some of that happens off campus, but I try to continue to build that community in different ways. Also, I try to build connection with students, so I work with the Brotherhood, I have partnered with the Sisterhood, I’ve worked with a couple different student-led affinity spaces, as well as CAMD clubs on campus, not only just to be a presence, to support whatever the student-led initiative is and to continue to grow that community.

          I am not a leader in BSU or AMP or, but the biggest thing that I do is just show up and participate. I remember when I was a Freshman and a Lower, I looked up to a ton of Black Seniors and Black Uppers, and I always thought to myself, ‘Oh my gosh, these people are so cool,’ like Amara ‘22 and Semira ’23. It’s nice to think of myself as someone that younger students can look up to, even if I am not a leader in affinity spaces. 
          <br><br>Before my role as a member of BSU, I was on AfLatAm for a while, but, as was the case for many, we saw a need for a space for just Black students on campus and there came BSU. In the following year, here I am as the Co-Head of BSU.

          Thus far, I think my two biggest ways in which I've contributed is education about Blackness, in terms of the African diaspora because I'm a very inquisitive person and what I love to do is I love to know. And currently, I am in a Black oratorical power class, which Andover has as an elective. It's incredible, and I think it's just perfect that it overlaps with this time of Black History Month. But really what Black oratorical power is is not just speeches and writings, but it's the consciousness that was present then and the linkages between what we see today and that tie. And there's so many ways in which Black oratorical power is represented. So just in learning about Black oratorical power, Black orators, and just, all sorts of storytellers, but not necessarily just oral storytelling, and sharing that knowledge with my peers, sharing that with my family back home is just one way in which I have contributed to the Black Andover community. <br><br>
          I have also shared my own story, my experiences. For example, on MLK Day I ran a workshop about the legacy of Nelson Mandela and the history of Apartheid South Africa, and its lasting legacy today. That was my second year running a workshop.

          <br><br>
          Then more so for Black History specifically, having a good balance of fun events for Black students, but educational events for the wider community and really celebrating that intersectionality within Blackness. For example, we had a presentation on Black-American sign language, which very few know about. And then this week we are having a collaboration with Gender Sexuality Alliance (GSA) and BSU about the experiences of heteronormity and Blackness and just that intersection, as well. So just organizing and creating and inviting people into these spaces, whether you identify as Black or not, is just one way in which I have felt I've contributed to this campus and the Black community.

          So I'm teaching Intro to African American literature, and I'm working with students from the Black community and students that are interested in understanding Blackness as a critical lens. Through that experience, I've met a lot of Black student leaders that have brought me into critical conversations about race and identity on campus and the complexities of being Black or the complexities of being a person of color in Andover. And I hope to continue that. I hope to position myself as a trusted adult that can participate in these kinds of conversations. I hope to, in the future, refine my course that I'm teaching, hone this critical lens and empower students even more so to question and synthesize new and complex ways of seeing the world.

          I won't take all the credit, but I'd say the biggest thing has been my role in BSU. We came together in the spring of 2021, and we knew that Black students needed their own space, so we created BSU, and we are kind of building it from the ground up and making our own traditions. One that's been a fan favorite of mine is the Jeopardy nights that we've had. We had our second one this year and a lot of people came, and we had some pizza, and the energy was high. It was just a way to quiz ourselves on historical figures and other Black history and just see how much we knew about Blackness on Andover and the history of our community. For example, one of the questions was about who the first Black person to graduate from Andover was—Richard T. Greener—and hopefully, if someone didn’t know the answer to the questions, they would be inspired to do a little more digging and educate themselves. Just bringing in that kind of accountability for us has been an important contribution and continuous goal of mine.

          I feel like just by being African as opposed to African-American or Black-American, I'm already bringing a very different shift of perspective. Some kids here are maybe first generation students, and they have aspects of cultural identity that are unique to them as well.
          <br><br>
          All of our experiences are equally important, but there are more African-American students than there are students who are from Africa. And yes, the onus is on me to shift people's perspective or to tunnel their vision towards a certain idea or depiction of the African continent. But I feel like just by being here, just by showing up, I bring the Africa that I come from, and I bring it to everyone else, and I love to share it. One way my Africa is by teaching people how to dance Kwaito, and I've done it on multiple occasions. I remember teaching it on my first weekend at Phillips Academy. I was fresh from Tanzania. I didn't even know the people I was dancing next to. We were just all laughing together and dancing. I found that people generally just love sharing someone else's culture, and in doing so, I learned that it brings us together. And so that's what I'm doing. I'm gonna share my culture. I'm gonna share my perspective. I'm gonna bring my voice. I'm gonna bring my identity into these spaces because I feel like it's important for all of us to be heard. Black History comes from Blackness, and Blackness, really, the roots of it are from Africa.

          I think I come at this job and I come at my classes through a distinctly black feminist optic.

<br><br>I think that's particularly powerful in an English department such as Andover. And I put these black feminist authors in conversation with our contemporary lives and the complexities of our lives, and I think it's productive.

And I enjoy sharing my experience with others, whether it be reaching out to other people or just by being here and helping other people recognize and understand their own identities. For example, some of the presentations that I have done for MLK day have been on my experiences being neurodivergent. I truly believe that to be one of my biggest contributions to the Black Andover community, just being a representative of an identity that you don’t often see publicized or normalized.

          The main point is that I have made it clear that I have really big ambitions. Whether it be taking a class or a community engagement at the same time, or something else. But in those actions, in making it clear that I can take on these more demanding roles, I feel like I have communicated on behalf of the students at this school who are very ambitious and want to do more.  Many of the things I do, despite college apps sitting in the back of my head, come from a place of faith, a place of belief in community. I hope that Andover can become a place where everyone can do more and do it for the benefit of their communities.and so that applies to the Black community, but it also applies to all other communities. 
          <br><br>On another note, since I am technically an international student, I think I have also been able to bring some unique perspectives to BSU, and to bring different ideas, and so I find a lot of joy  in that. For tutoring, my peer mentee is a a Black freshman, and she is so young, and it is hard to believe that I was once in her position, but it brings me so much joy to see where she is and to understand where she is coming from and to connect to her help her not just over math, but in our identities and lives.

There are some very strict stratifications at Andover, and coming into this school I didn’t fit neatly into any one category or any one identity that cliqued to create friend groups and so it was hard for me at first. My freshman and Lower year, I didn’t find anyone who I really connected to. It was only the third quarter of Lower year that I just found peace and more comfort in being myself and speaking my mind, not for any particular reason, but simply because this is what I want to do.

          I mean, every day, I find myself getting a bit more amazed that I'm here. Across all the identities and communities I hold myself and engage with on this campus, the environment has a standard pressure that’s so high that we talk so much about never really settling. Just being here, I guess, waking up loving knowledge and spreading goodness everyday, is a testament to our strength. I’m very proud of it. Sometimes it's the little things that keep you going. 

<br><br>If there's something specific, I think a lot about a Computer Science class that I took, and we used a program there called OpenSCAD, a CAD software run by code.And my northern star is rollercoasters. I want to design roller coasters, which might not be the ultimate direction of my life, but it encapsulates everything I'm genuinely interested in within the realm of science and STEM.

<br><br>With this program, I decided to create a roller coaster track modeling system. Although basic, I discovered the power of using code to manipulate parameters, enabling changes in length, vendor, or the specific track type. This opened up endless possibilities for creative design, and I ended up printing out several tiny track models for my final. I found the project inspiring and accessible, and it always served as a reminder that I'm on the right path. That no matter what, I have a guiding north star, and I am getting closer to it with everything that I am learning. So really just learning to use OpenSCAD and being given the opportunity to interact with such a program is one of my proudest moments.

          Well, this term I'm an official timer for track. It's the first time that I've been involved in track and field, and I've been learning about shot put. I knew that Andover would be an experience that would ask me to grow in a lot of new ways, and so I really have enjoyed being a part of that. In the fall, I was also part of meditative walking, which I think should be an Olympic sport, honestly, because it's so great, and the students were great. So I was really proud of my involvement in that class and, again, how I learned from that experience.
